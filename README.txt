#Project 1 Implemented and compared three prime number testing algorithms (Miller-Rabin, Eratosthenes, and Atkin) in Python, with a user interface to select the algorithm.

#Project 2 Developed a cryptography tool for encryption, decryption, and file integrity checking. Implemented lightweight encryption algorithms, CBC/OFB modes, and a tool to add encrypted metadata to files. Also, implemented TinyJambu and ASCON cryptographic algorithms from scratch without using external libraries.
